# Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Xamarin.Forms.WPF
An example of how the Esri ArcGIS Runtime for WPF can be wrapped in a Xamarin.Forms renderer.

Note that this isn't a full wrapper of all the MapView and SceneView members (but it's a good start).

If you use this and add more members, please considering submitting a PR.
